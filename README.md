# NVCE

What was initially intended to be a simple browser extension has now evolved into its own website. NVCE retrieves the headlines of news articles from RSS feeds. It then takes those headlines and parses into individual words. Those individual words are categorized according to what kind of word they are(noun, poser verb, etc). The parsed headlines are algorithmically compared to other headlines to determine a "trust factor" for each article.
