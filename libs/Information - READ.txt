The main execute is called through verifManager.py or can be ran
by calling the displayFeed() function and passing it a recognized outlet name.

The latest headline is stored in sampleTxt.txt. This headline can be changed 
(manually) to re-run all headlines in the RSS feed.

Executing this will run the whole system: checking the provided feed for 
new headlines and parsing/comparing/verifying any found. This will also 
update the centralized reference of the outlet's RSS.

The central reference can be found in the trendingHls json file, with the 
individual outlet feeds being stored in the "TrendingHLs_Spec" dictionary. 
This dictionary can be accessed to display current outlet-specific headlines.

Examples of accessing JSON dictionaries through Python can be found in
the updateTPHls() function on line 215 of the PHlLog_Limbo module if needed.

No function exists currently to display recent outlet-specific headlines.



For ideas, basic website functionality should include displaying current
outlet-specific headlines and updating (refreshing) the RSS feeds periodically.
